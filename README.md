# Learning Concurrency and Multithreading in Java

This README outlines my learning path for understanding concurrency and multithreading in Java. The topics covered span from basic concepts to advanced implementations, ensuring a comprehensive grasp of multithreading in Java. I began with understanding the concept of multitasking and how it allows multiple tasks to run concurrently. Next, I learned the distinctions between threads and processes, including memory sharing and execution differences. I explored threads in Java, their lifecycle, and how they are managed by the JVM. I also studied the main thread in Java applications and its role in program execution. Various methods to create threads in Java were covered, including extending the `Thread` class and implementing the `Runnable` interface. I delved into the `Thread` class in detail, exploring its methods and properties. Synchronization in Java was another key topic, focusing on managing access to shared resources and preventing race conditions. I learned about race conditions and the importance of concurrency control. A practical demonstration of synchronization using stacks with synchronized methods and blocks helped solidify these concepts. I also learned how to use objects as locks to synchronize critical sections of code, and I studied synchronization in static methods and its impact on class-level locking. The rules and best practices for effective synchronization in Java were explored, along with in-depth coverage of race conditions and strategies to avoid them. Thread safety was another important topic, where I learned techniques to ensure safe interaction between threads. The `volatile` keyword was discussed, including its use in ensuring visibility of changes to variables across threads and its application in the Singleton design pattern. The Producer-Consumer problem was studied, with a focus on designing a blocking queue using `wait()` and `notify()`. I learned about different thread states and transitions during a threadâ€™s lifecycle, and explored how threads run, yield control, sleep, wake up, and communicate through waiting and notifying mechanisms. Scenarios where threads time out and how to handle them were also covered. I studied how to interrupt threads and manage thread interruptions, and the concept of thread joining to ensure thread completion before proceeding. Thread priority and how it influences thread scheduling were examined, along with the role of the thread scheduler in managing thread execution order. Deadlocks were discussed, including their causes and strategies to prevent them, and I engaged in a practical exercise to create a deadlock scenario in Java and discuss ways to resolve it. By following this learning path, I aim to gain a solid foundation in concurrency and multithreading in Java, enabling me to write efficient, thread-safe code.
